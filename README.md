To run, simply install the package globally, and run it in the directory where you want to initialize your project!
`yarn install react-boiler-cli -global`

`react-boiler-cli`

What you get by default:

- React 17
- Typescript
- Styled Components
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Eslint + Prettier

From there, the cli will ask you about the app you are initializing, and add things like state management, page routing, a UI library, etc. as needed based on your answers.
